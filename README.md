# AI-Playing-Atari-Game-BreakOut
A review over NN code creating an AI agent that can play the atari game BREAKOUT.

My last personal attempt at this problem before using C51 code is documented in file 'BREAKOUT_last_attempt.ipynb' with summary and explanations.

The solution is based on categorical C51 extension of DQN using Reinforcement Learning.

Credit & Source - the code is from https://wandb.ai/cleanrl/cleanrl.benchmark/runs/2r5fagq8/overview
